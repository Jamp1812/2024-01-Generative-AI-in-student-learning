# Generative AI in Student Learning: Breakthrough or Setback?

This project is a survey on the topic of generative AI in student learning. 
It was conducted for a data literacy course at the University of TÃ¼bingen as part of a Cognitive Science Master's degree. 
The project was collaborated on by Jan Goebel and David Mueller. The supervising professor is Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig.

## Introduction

With tools like chatGPT and similar artificial intelligence based systems. More and more students
are using generative AI to support their learning or to generate content for presentations and essays. 
With our research project we want to find
out how prevalent the use of generative AI is and
what factors are causing its use. Additionally we
want to find out if students report to benefit from the
use and how they would like universities to respond to those systems.

## Contributing

We highly encourage everyone interested to use the gathered data for further analysis.
We hope that our data collection and analysis will help current and future students to benefit greatly from the opportunities offered by generative AI. Analyses based on this data should take such a goal into account.
