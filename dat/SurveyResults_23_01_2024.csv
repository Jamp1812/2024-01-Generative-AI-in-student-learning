Dafür braucht es natürlich einen Willen Veränderungen zu akzeptieren von allen Seiten besonders von Lehrenden und der Uni Bürokratie. "

Wenn ich etwas selber kann, mache ich es selber, und wenn nicht bin ich ja an der Uni um es zu lernen. Nicht um es eine KI machen zu lassen.

Das kann KI, wie ich höre. Aber wie gesagt, ich bin ja hier, um zu lernen...","Bei kreativen Aufgaben halte ich es tatsächlich für unmoralisch, generative KI einzusetzen. Die klaut schließlich auch nur effektiv von sehr, sehr vielen Künstlern im Internet gleichzeitig. 
Wenn man sich dadurch eine Chemie- oder Programmieraufgabe lösen lassen will, um einmal zu sehen, wie es richtig ginge, verstehe ich das schon. Vielleicht wird es irgendwann auch unumgänglich, dass ich das auch mache, wer weiß. 

Aber wenn es um wichtige Dinge geht, die tatsächlich dringend richtig sein sollten, vertraue ich generativen KIs bei weitem nicht genug. Ich habe von zu vielen Beispielen gehört, wo sie absurd falsche Antworten auf Dinge gegeben haben, oder sich Fakten einfach ""ausgedacht"" haben. Die KI weiß schließlich nicht, was wahr ist. Sie kann ja nur fortgeschritten klauen, nicht wirklich denken, und hat kein Konzept von Wahrheit."

Wäre spannend zu sehen, wie der Umgang mit Ki vom Studifach abhängt bzw. wie die KI-Literacy der Professoren vom Fachbereich abhängt.

Diese sollte auch an den Universitäten vermittelt werden. Die Tools sind da, Studenten werden sie nutzen ob erlaubt oder nicht. Aber wenn sie in ihrem Umgang nicht geschult werden, verwenden sie sie falsch. Generative KI Programme sind gut geeignet um Texte zusammenzufassen, vereinfacht zu erklären oder einfacher Fehler zu finden. Aber nicht um für jemanden Texte (insbesondere wissenschaftliche) zu schreiben oder als Ersatz für Suchmaschinen.  Die Ergebnisse können immer falsch, die Quellen erfunden sein. Es gibt zur Zeit positive und negative Aussichten. Wie sich unser Umgang mit KI Programmen in Zukunft gestalten wird, liegt vermutlich auch an den Bildungseinrichtungen und welche Kompetenzen sie den Schülern und Studenten heute mitgeben. "

You can craft the inital draft, and then ChatGPT can work wonders on it by fixing your grammar, increasing flow etc. One problem I observe is that now, everyone looks like they have the same overly cautious overly kind way of ""writing"", which mostly stems from not being able to add your touch to model output. An experienced user can decide for themselves where to use their own voice and where to take help from AI.

Other than that, I found this aspect of the survey lacking: You have some questions about AI model development and guidelines, but you do not have any questions about guidelines on how to use AI. The current discussion, excluding some fame-seeking ignorant rhetoricans, is about if we should regulate AI research or if we should regulate AI applications. My opinion is that we should not regulate research (unless it is applied research in defense technologies or something similar of course), but rather we should focus on regulating the use of AI."

Das hilft also nicht, einen möglichen Bias zu beseitigen, was ja für Studien essentiell ist, sondern verstärkt diesen womöglich noch. KI weigert sich oft unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen, warum sie bestimmte Aufgaben nicht erfüllen könnte. Nutzer, die eine un- oder weniger zensierte KI haben, haben dieses Problem womöglich nicht. Auch kann der Studienerfolg mehr noch vom Geld abhängen, wenn man sich eine besonders leistungsfähige KI leisten kann, andere hingegen nicht. Außerdem verstehe ich nicht recht, warum KI gelegentlich Quellen erfindet, was für eine wissenschaftliche Recherchearbeit echt Gift sein kann."

Do teachers have a good way to evaluate such 'writing'? Do plagiarism statements cover the distinction between one's own work and generated text?"
